<hr />
<h3>There Will Be Blood</h3>
<p>This Paul Thomas Anderson film is a masterpiece character study of a budding oil baron's greediness and relentlessness to win.</p>
<h3>12 Years a Slave</h3>
<p>The true story of Solomon Northrup, a free man captured and sold into slavery in the American South, that is one of the grandest audio-visual experiences to behold.</p>
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>An incredible, unique story from Bong Joon-ho. Masterful characters and an intense sense of place from one of the greatest directors of all time.</p>
